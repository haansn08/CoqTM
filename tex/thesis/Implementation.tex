\chapter{Implementation in Coq}
\label{chap:implementation}

\lstset{style=coq}



% A full chapter for the implementation might not be worse it.  I think it is more important which libraries/plugins we use and how many lines of code
% do we need.  Does it really matter how we implement, e.g. tapes or Turing machines in Coq, because all definitions can be translated
% straight-forwardly to Coq.  The reader of the thesis can click on the theorems to read the source code, if he is interested.


In this chapter\todo{or section?}, we outline our implementation of the framework of this thesis in the theorem prover Coq.  We do not assume
additional axioms.  The implementation compiles with the Coq versions 8.7 and 8.8.

\section{Used Libraries}
\label{sec:coq-libraries}

\paragraph{Base Library and Finite Types}

We use a modified version of the library for the lecture \textit{Introduction to Computational Logic} by Prof.\ Smolka.  This library extends the
standard library of Coq with additional functions and automation for lists and decidable predicates.  On top of this library, we use the library of
finite types that was developed by Jan Menz in his bachelor's thesis \cite{JanMenz}.  The following listing outlines the definition of decidable
predicates and finite types:

\begin{lstlisting}
Definition dec (P:Prop) := {P} + {~ P}.
Definition eq_dec (X:Type) := forall x y, dec (x=y).
Structure eqType := EqType {
  eqtype :> Type;
  decide_eq : eq_dec eqtype
}.
Canonical Structure eqType_CS X (A: eq_dec X) := EqType X.
Class finTypeC (type: eqType) : Type := FinTypeC {
  enum : list type;
  enum_ok : forall x : type, count enum x = 1
}.
Structure finType : Type := FinType {
  type :> eqType;
  class : finTypeC type
}.
Canonical Structure finType_CS (X:Type) {p : eq_dec X} {class : finTypeC (EqType X)} : finType := FinType (EqType X).
\end{lstlisting}%

The coercions (\lstinline!:>!) make it possible to use finite types \lstinline{F:finType} as types, i.e.\ we can write \lstinline!x:F!.  The canonical
structures enable automatic inference of the structure, for example we have a function \lstinline!index : forall F:finType, F -> nat! and we can write
\lstinline!index true!.

\paragraph{Retraction Library}

We implemented a library for retractions.  We use a typeclass for the existence of retractions between two types.
\begin{lstlisting}
Section Retract.
  Variable X Y : Type.
  Definition retract (f : X -> Y) (g : Y -> option X) :=
    forall x y, g y = Some x <-> y = f x.
  Class Retract :=
    {
      Retr_f : X -> Y;
      Retr_g : Y -> option X;
      Retr_retr : retract Retr_f Retr_g;
    }.
End Retract.
Arguments Retr_f { _ _ _ }.
Arguments Retr_g { _ _ _ }.
\end{lstlisting}
The \lstinline!Arguments! \textit{venacular} command makes $X$, $Y$, and the instance contextual implicit.  This means that
\lstinline!Retr_f : X -> Y!, where \lstinline!X! and \lstinline!Y! are inferred from the context.  We define instances for the retractions in
Section~\ref{sec:retracts}.  It is important for the termination of typeclass inference, to not declare retraction composition as an instance.
Instead, we embed the composition into retractions, i.e.\ instead of defining a retraction like $RetrLft : X \hookrightarrow X+Y$, we define and
declare as an instance an operator
\begin{lstlisting}
Retract_inl : forall A B C : Type, Retract A B -> Retract A (B + C)
\end{lstlisting}
We also define (but not declare as an instance) the retraction composition operator
\begin{lstlisting}
ComposeRetract : forall A B C : Type, Retract A B -> Retract B C -> Retract A C
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Inhabited Types}

We also have a library for inhabited types.  Whenever we need a semantically irrelevant value, we can just write \lstinline!default! and Coq infers
the type and inserts a value with the following typeclass:
\begin{lstlisting}
Class inhabitedC (X : Type) :=
  {
    default : X;
  }.
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Vectors and $\Fin_k$}

We use the type constructors \lstinline!Vector.t! and \lstinline!Fin.t! from Coq's standard library.  However, many basic lemmas and functions are
missing for this type.  We have a small library that adds the missing functions and lemmas.  It also provides some tactics, for example to make case
distinctions over \lstinline!Fin.t (S n)!.  We also introduce a notation for elements of $\Fin_k$.

\paragraph{smpl}

We use Sigurd~Schneider's smpl plugin \cite{SMPL}.  I lets the user add tactics to a tactic database and provides a tactic that applies the first
applicable tactic from the database.  We use this plugin for proof automation, more on that below.
