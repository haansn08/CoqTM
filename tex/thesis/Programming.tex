\chapter{Programming Turing Machines}
\label{chap:programming}

In Chapter \ref{chap:combining}, we introduced control-flow operators for Turing machines.
In this chapter we define what it means that a tape \emph{contains} a \emph{value}.
When we \emph{program} Turing machines, we only use \emph{value-manipulating} machines, combinators, and lifts.
Then we introduce a convention, so that a machine computes a function and give a few case-studies (Add, Mult, Nth).
