First of all, I want to thank my parents for supporting me in every imaginable way.  Without my parents, this thesis would not exists, me neither.

I want to thank Prof.~Smolka for introducing me to the field of functional programming and computational logic.  I always appreciated his passion in
his lectures.  Without him, I would not have found the field of computational logic and formal verification.  I also recognise the help of Kathrin
Stark, who helped me getting into this toppic, in particular because I missed the first three weeks of \textit{Introduction to Computational Logic}.
I can not imagine that this thesis would have happened, if there where not Kathrin Stark and Clara Schneidewind.  I want to thank Prof.~Smolka for
giving me the opportunity to write my thesis at his chair.  I really appreciate the atmosphere together with motivated PhD students, especially with
Kathrin Stark, Fabian Kunze, and Yannick Forster.

I feel obliged to say special words of thank to Yannick Forster, who advised this thesis and the development of the framework presented in this
thesis.  In many weekly meetings, over the course of one year, we discussed how the framework could look like.  More often that not, Yannick could see
the obvious when I was too focused on details.  Over the course of the development, he also helped me to organise myself.  I am thankful that he
provided a {\LaTeX} template for this thesis and that he proof read my text many times.
