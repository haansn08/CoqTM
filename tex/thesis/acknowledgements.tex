First of all, I want to thank Prof.~Smolka for giving me the opportunity to write my thesis at his chair.

I also want to thank Prof.~Smolka and Kathrin Stark for introducing me to the field of programming languages and formal semantics.
I always found Prof.~Smolka's lectures very inspiring, and he always showed great passion.

I furthermore thank all members of Prof.~Smolka's chair, especially Kathrin Stark, Fabian Kunze, and Yannick Forster.

Of course, I also want to thank my parents.
They supported me in many ways.

I thank all my friends. \todo{Find friends.}
