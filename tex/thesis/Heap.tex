\chapter{Simulating a Heap Machine}
\label{chap:heap}


In this chapter, we will use all technics, to implement a Turing machine that simulates an abstract heap machine.

Definition of the heap machine.

Definition of the machine / architecture / \dots

From the semantics of this machine, it follows that the halting problem of this abstract heap machine reduces to the halting problem of multi-tape Turing machines.

We can refine terms of closed lambda expressions to states of the abstract heap machine.
Hence, the halting problemm of lambda terms reduces to the halting problem of multi-tape Turing machines.
