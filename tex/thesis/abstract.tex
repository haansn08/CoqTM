Although Turing machines build the traditional foundation of the theory of computation and complexity, Turing machines are usually not formally
verified.  Authors of textbooks usually leave invariants to figure out of the reader, or employ the \textit{Church-Turing thesis} to (informally)
prove that a function is Turing computable.  One reason for that is that Turing machines are unstructured.

We present a framework developed in the theorem prover Coq, in which we can program and certify multi-tape Turing machines.  We showcase the power of
this framework, by programming and certifying a multi-tape Turing machine that simulates a two-stack machine.
