	abstract = {We discuss the formalization, in the Matita Theorem Prover, of basic results on multi-tapes Turing machines, up to the existence of a (certified) Universal Machine, and propose it as a natural benchmark for comparing different interactive provers and assessing the state of the art in the mechanization of formal reasoning. The work is meant to be a preliminary step towards the creation of a formal repository in Complexity Theory, and is a small piece in our long-term Reverse Complexity program, aiming to a comfortable, machine independent axiomatization of the field.},
